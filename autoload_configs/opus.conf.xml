        <!--  "maxaveragebitrate" setting -  this bitrate is chosen so that FEC is present in the payload whenever the Opus codec decides it can add it. There is a threshold bitrate for FEC activation in OPUS : 12400 . Lower than this bitrate , there will be no FEC   -->
        <param name="maxaveragebitrate" value="18000"/>

        <!--
            "maxplaybackrate"  setting - sample rate of encoder. this will tell the remote party that it's pointless to send us higher rates, because we will
            downsample anyway, so better send 8000 to spare us some CPU
        -->
        <param name="maxplaybackrate" value="8000"/>

        <!--
            "packet-loss-percent" setting - is the initial packet loss that we pass to the encoder. This value in conjunction with the maxaveragebitrate value will make
            the codec decide if it will use FEC or not
        -->
        <param name="packet-loss-percent" value="10"/>

        <!--
            "keep-fec-enabled" setting  - will enforce the encoder to use FEC regardless of the maxaveragebitrate supplied to it. In fact it will recalculate  a new bitrate based
            on the packetloss percentage taken from RTCP arriving to us from the user app if the packet loss is higher than 10%. You might expect that this bitrate would be lower
            than the maxaveragebitrate, but in reality the actual bitrate will vary with packet loss during the call - but only to keep FEC enabled. If there's no more packet loss
            during the call then the bitrate will go to the supplied maxaveragebitrate (the one set from remote fmtp or local config file).

        ###

            This works in today's networks. For example a congested WiFi router or core router will drop a 60 bytes packet (40 bytes IP/UDP/RTP header  +  20 bytes voice payload ) as
            easy as an 70 bytes packet, so if you increase the bitrate with 10 bytes per packet (it's the price to pay of having FEC enabled - but the good side is that only certain
            packets will contain it ) will not matter that much for that congested router, it will continue to forward some packets and drop some packets in the same manner. It's a
            packet-loss pattern (many small gaps). The usage of FEC will improve the audio quality because there will be redundant information in the packets eventually arriving at
            the decoder after the congestion adventure. This is just an example, don't take these values above exactly as they are (60, 70 , 10) . Only 40 bytes for header overhead
            is a correct value and it's the only fixed value in calculating network bitrate. "maxaveragebitrate"  is an average , and the actual network bandwidth used might be a
            little bit higher or a little bit smaller, depending on the content being encoded. The voice payload size varies (because Opus is VBR) and so does the FEC payload inside
            the voice payload.

        <!--
            "use-jb-lookahead" setting  - you must enable  the jitter buffer for FEC decoding to work. This setting has impact on decoding received FEC - it will
            improve the audio quality greatly under packet loss conditions. We decode incoming FEC by looking in the jitter buffer, checking if we have the next
            packet (only if the current packet is missing due to packet loss ) and then checking if it has FEC info in it. If it has FEC, then first we decode the
            FEC and then we decode the main payload. This is n+1 FEC .

            From FS 1.6.11 there is another setting called "adjust-bitrate" that you can put in opus.conf.xml - this will attempt to vary the bitrate during the call as well and it will work in all modes. "adjust-bitrate" would
            work in the whole bitrate range .
